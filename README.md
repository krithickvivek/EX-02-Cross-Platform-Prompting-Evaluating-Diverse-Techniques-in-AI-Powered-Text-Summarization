## AIM:
To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based) across different AI platforms (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Copilot) in a specific task: Text Summarization.



## Scenario:
You are part of a content curation team for an educational platform that delivers quick summaries of research papers to undergraduate students. Your task is to summarize a 500-word technical article on "The Basics of Blockchain Technology" using multiple AI platforms and prompting strategies.

Your goal is to determine which combination of prompting technique + platform provides the best summary in terms of:
- Accuracy
- Coherence
- Simplicity
- Speed
- User experience

## Algorithm:
1. Select the 500-word article titled “The Basics of Blockchain Technology.”
2. Choose AI platforms: ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and Copilot.
3. Apply prompting techniques:
   - Zero-shot: Directly ask for a summary.
   - Few-shot: Provide sample summaries before the task.
   - Chain-of-Thought: Ask model to reason step-by-step.
   - Role-based: Instruct model to summarize as a teacher for students.
4. Generate summaries using all combinations of platforms and techniques.
5. Evaluate based on:
   - Accuracy
   - Coherence
   - Simplicity
   - Speed
   - User Experience
6. Record scores on a 5-point scale and compute averages.
7. Identify best-performing combination.

## Output:

| Summary  | Accuracy | Coherence | Simplicity | Speed | User Experience |
|----------|----------|-----------|------------|-------|-----------------|
| ChatGPT  | High     | Very Good – flows well in one paragraph | Moderate – slightly technical | Fast | Good – concise but less structured |
| Gemini   | High     | Good – clear structure but slightly verbose | Good – explains terms clearly | Moderate | Good – balances detail and readability |
| Claude   | Excellent| Very High – structured with headings | High – easy to follow | Moderate | Excellent – clean, clear, well-organized |
| Copilot  | Excellent| Excellent – well-structured, logical flow | Very High – simple and engaging | High | Excellent – visually appealing and user-friendly |

## Result: 
- **Best Combination:** Copilot + Zero-Shot Prompting  
- **Reason:** Delivered the most accurate, coherent, and visually engaging summary with excellent simplicity, speed, and user experience.  
- **Observation:** Zero-shot prompting gave strong results across all platforms, but Copilot’s structured and appealing format made it stand out.
